# Sparsified_dynamics_modeling

This is a repository containing MATLAB codes for the paper entitled, "Network-theoretic approach to sparsified discrete vortex dynamics", JFM, 2015. Please cite this work when using the codes.

Main functions: 

main_sparsified_dynamics.m : Performs graph sparcification and runs the sparsified-dynamics model.

main_example: Runs spectral sparsification on an example graph 

Functions: 

sparsified_spectral: Performs spectral sparsification of graphs. For details, refer to Spielman and Srivastava, "Graph sparsification by effective resistances", SIAM 2011. Please also cite this work.
